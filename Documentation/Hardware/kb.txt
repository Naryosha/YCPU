Behaviour:

    HWQ $02:
    R1  R2?     Message
    $00 Y       Set mode based on R2. 
                    Default: get only press events, where possible translated to ASCII.
                    R2 & $01 = get press, up, and down events.
                    R2 & $02 = do not translate presses to ASCII.
                All pending events cleared. Returns MSG_ACK
                
    $01 Y       Get pending events. Memory at [R2] set as follows:
                    + $0000 = count of events (max 15)
                    + $0001 = event 0
                    + $0002 = event 1
                       ...
                    + $000F = event 15
                If event count is less than 15, only memory up to the number
                of pending events will be set.
                
Format of keyboard events:
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    .SAC EEEE KKKK KKKK
        S = shift down
        A = alt down
        C = ctrl down
        E = event type (1 = up, 2 = down, 3 = press, 4 = ascii press)
        K = key-code.
            k is ASCII if the event type is 4, otherwise, a virtual key code.
