    The Ypsilon Graphics Adaptor (YGA) is a standard monitor interface. It
    allows the programmer to select pixel addressable and character-based
    display modes, controlled by setting values via the HWQ instruction. The
    adaptor has 128kb of memory on board.
    
=== Interfacing details ========================================================

    DeviceType:     $0001 (Display)
    ManufacturerID: $0000 (YPSILON)
    DeviceID:       $0000
    DeviceRevision: $0001
    
    HWQ $02 Message is used for Mode Selection. See 'Mode Selection' below.
    
    If bit 15 of R1 is clear, set adapter state based on R1. Other options may
    be defined in R2. See 'Mode Selection' below. Following the hardware query,
    R0 is set as follows:
                
        $0000   ERROR_NOT_VALID  Mode in R1 was not a valid mode.
        $0001   MSG_ACK          Mode set based on R1.
        $FFFF   ERROR_BROKEN     Display failure, broken, no output.
        
    If bit 15 of R1 is set, the adapter will write 32 bytes of undefined values
    to Data Segment at the address in R2.
    
    
=== Mode Selection =============================================================

    The programmer selects a display mode and queries display modes via HWQ $02.
    For more information about HWQ $02, see YCPU documentation 3.C.1.
    
    The value in R1 is used to determine the display adapter's action. The high
    4 bits of R1 should be clear.The low 12 bits of R1 are an index that defines
    the mode that is selected by this instruction:
    
    R1.     Notes
    $000    Display inactivated. No signal will be output.
    
    $001    LEM180c compatability mode. Character based, 16 color. Outputs a
            display of 128x96 pixels, made up of 32x12 characters, each 4 pixels
            wide and 8 pixels high. Each character is defined by a 16-bit word
            in video memory, with its own foreground and background color out of
            a palette of 16 colors. The state of bit 0 of R2 selects which
            screen ram page is output: clear selects page 0, set selects page 1.
    
=== Mode $01: LEM180c Compatability ============================================

    The LEM180c is a 128x96 pixel color display adapter. The output display of
    the adapter is made up of 32x12 tiles, each 4 pixels in width by 8 pixels in
    height. Each tile displays one monochrome characters out of 128, based on
    the contents of a 16-bit word describing the tile. Each tile has its own
    foreground and background color out of a palette of 16 colors.
    
    LEM180c compatability mode uses the YGA internal memory to define the map of
    characters displayed on the screen, define what the characters look like,
    and the palette of colors used to display the characters. The memory map is:
    
    $0000 - $03FF:    Screen RAM page 0.
    $0400 - $07FF:    Screen RAM page 1.
    $0800 - $09FF:    Character RAM.
    $0C00 - $0C1F:    Palette RAM.
    
    $0000 - $07FF - SCRRAM, repeats every $0400 bytes.
    $0800 - $0BFF - CHRRAM, repeats every $0200 bytes.
    $0C00 - $0FFF - PALRAM, repeats every $0020 bytes.
    
    Each Screen RAM page is a list of 512 x 16-bit words. Each word describes a
    single tile on screen. Each word is formatted as follows:
                
        FEDC BA98 7654 3210
        ffff bbbb Bccc cccc
        f - palette color to display in foreground of this tile.
        b - palette color to display in background of this tile.
        B - blink this tile.
        c - tile index to display in this tile.
    
    Character RAM is a list of 128 x 32-bit words. Each word describes a
    character that can be displayed in a single tile. Characters are 4x8 1-bit
    pixels, read from bottom to top then left to right. For example, the
    character F looks like this:
    
       word0 = 1111111100001001
       word1 = 0000100100000000
    
    Or, split into octets:
    
       word0 = 11111111 /
               00001001
       word1 = 00001001 /
               00000000
    
    Palette RAM is a list of 16 x 16-bit words. Each word describes a
    single color for the 16 colors in the palette. The format of each word is
    as follows:
    
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    .... rrrr gggg bbbb
    
    Where r, g, b are the red, green and blue channels. A higher value means a
    lighter color.
