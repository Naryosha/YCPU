The YCPU Specification
====

The YCPU Specification describes an imaginary 16-bit processor with a comprehensive instruction set and features that make it both easy to program for and easy to emulate. The [specification document](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/YCPU/blob/master/Documentation/ycpu.txt "YCPU Specification Document") is very thorough, with all opcodes, interrupts, and error states included in detail. The specification is released to the public domain, and anyone may use it for any purpose without permission or attribution.

A toolchain is planned to support development for the YCPU. At present, a model emulator implemented in C# has been implemented, and released under the MIT license.
