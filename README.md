The YCPU Specification
====

The YCPU Specification describes an imaginary 16-bit processor with a comprehensive instruction set and features that make it both easy to program for and easy to emulate. The specification is thorough, with all opcodes, interrupts, and error states included in detail.

The specification is released to the public domain, and anyone may use it for any purpose without permission or attribution.

A model emulator implemented in C# is included with the specification under the MIT license.
