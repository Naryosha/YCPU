    The LEM180c is a 128x96 pixel color display adapter. The output display of
    the adapter is made up of 32x12 tiles, each 4 pixels in width by 8 pixels in
    height. Each tile displays one monochrome characters out of 128, based on
    the contents of a 16-bit word describing the tile. Each tile has its own
    foreground and background color out of a palette of 16 colors.
    
=== Adapter Memory =============================================================

    The LEM180c has internal memory describing the 128 characters, the map of
    which characters to display in each tile, and the palette. The memory is
    laid out in a single bank, as follows:
    
    0x0000 - 0x07FF - SCRRAM, repeats every 0x0400 bytes.
    0x0800 - 0x0BFF - CHRRAM, repeats every 0x0200 bytes.
    0x0C00 - 0x0FFF - PALRAM, repeats every 0x0020 bytes.
    
    SCRRAM (Screen Ram) is a list of 512 x 16-bit words. Each word describes a
    single tile on screen. Each word is formatted as follows:
    
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    ffff bbbb Bccc cccc
    
    f - palette color to display in foreground of this tile.
    b - palette color to display in background of this tile.
    B - blink this tile.
    c - tile index to display in this tile.
    
    CHRRAM (Character Ram) is a list of 128 x 32-bit words. Each word describes
    a character that can be displayed in a single tile. Characters are 4x8 1-bit
    pixels, read from bottom to top then left to right. For example, the
    character F looks like this:
    
       word0 = 1111111100001001
       word1 = 0000100100000000
    
    Or, split into octets:
    
       word0 = 11111111 /
               00001001
       word1 = 00001001 /
               00000000
    
    PALRAM (Palette Ram) is a list of 16 x 16-bit words. Each word describes a
    single color for the 16 colors in the palette. The format of each word is
    as follows:
    
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    .... rrrr gggg bbbb
    
    Where r, g, b are the red, green and blue channels. A higher value means a
    lighter color.
