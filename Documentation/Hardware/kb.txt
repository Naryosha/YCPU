                    Default: get only press events.

    $01 Y       Get pending events. Memory at DS[R2] set as follows:
                    + $0000 = count of events (max 15)
                    + $0002 = event 1
                    + $0004 = event 2
                       ...
                    + $001E = event 15
                If event count is less than 15, only memory up to the number
                of pending events will be set.
