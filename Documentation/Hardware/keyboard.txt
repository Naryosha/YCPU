$00     Set mode based on R2. Clear all pending events. R0 set to MSG_ACK.
        R2: FEDC BA98 7654 3210
            .... .... .... .TPE
            E = 0: Do not report key down and key up events.
                1: Report key down and key up events.
            P = 0: Do not report key press events.
                1: Report key press events.
            T = 0: Where possible, translate key press events to ASCII.
                1: Do not translate key press events to ASCII.
                Default: get only press events.
                R2 & $01 = get press, up, and down events.
            
            
$01         Get pending event buffer. Returns number of events in R0.
            Expected values in R0 are 0 - 16. If there is an error, R0 will
            be MSG_ERROR ($FFFF).
            Memory at DS[R2] set as follows:
                + $0000 = event 0
                + $0002 = event 1
                + $0004 = event 2
                   ...
                + $001E = event 15
            If event count is less than 15, only memory up to the number
            of pending events will be set.
                
Format of keyboard events:
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    TSAC EEEE KKKK KKKK
        T = key code has been translated to ASCII
        S = shift down
        A = alt down
        C = ctrl down
        E = event type (1 = up, 2 = down, 3 = press)
        K = key-code.
            k is either ASCII (if T bit is set), or a virtual key code.
