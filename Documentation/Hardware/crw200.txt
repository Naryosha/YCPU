                         YPSILONTECH's CRW200
                        
                           A data cartridge for
                          all your storage needs

    The memo to your boss. Your kid's school work. The latest software. At
YPSILONTECH, we know you need a place to keep all your data. You need storage
that is portable and reliable. That's why you need the CRW200 - the
revolutionary solid state storage device that is readable, writable, and
hardened against anomolous bit flips.

=== Drive speed ================================================================

    The drive can read a single 512b sector to its buffer in approximately
    5.04ms

=== Cartridge size =============================================================

    The CRW200 provides 4096 512b (256x2b) sectors of data. The total size
    on cartridge is 2 mega-bytes.

=== Interface details ==========================================================

    HWQ $02 Message:
    
    R1  R2?     Message
    $00 Y       Query state. R0 is set to state code:
                fedcba98 76543210
                eip..... ......bm
                e = error state, query for error
                i = interrupt enabled.
                w = write protected.
                b = busy read/write
                m = media present.
                
                R2 is used to set/disable interrupt. If R2 is 0, disables
                interrupt. Else, enables interrupt. While interrupt is active,
                drive will cause hardware interrupt when STATE e:0->1,
                b:1->0 or m bit changes.
                
    $01         Query error. Last error status is returned in R0. Error status
                cleared on read.
                0x0000 ERROR_NONE       No error since last poll.
                0x0001 ERROR_BUSY       Drive is busy performing an action
                0x0002 ERROR_NO_MEDIA   Attempted to read or write with no cartridge inserted.
                0x0003 ERROR_PROTECTED  Attempted to write to write protected cartridge.
                0x0004 ERROR_EJECT      The cartridge was removed while reading or writing.
                0x0005 ERROR_BAD_SECTOR The requested sector is broken, the data on it is lost.
                0xffff ERROR_BROKEN     There's been some major software or hardware problem,
                                        try turning off and turning on the device again.
    
    $02 Y       Read sector. Begin read sector index in R2 to buffer. R0 set to 0 if reading
                is possible and started, else set to 1 and internal error code set.
                Reading is only possible if the state is STATE_READY or STATE_READY_WP.
                
    $03 Y       Write sector. Write buffer to sector index R2. 0 set to 0 if writing
                is possible and started, else set to 1 and internal error code set.
                Writing is only possible if the state is STATE_READY.
