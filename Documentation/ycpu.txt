### 2. Hardware Information ####################################################

The YCPU is a 16-bit processor designed to be powerful without being complex. A
hobbyist can begin programming software knowing only the syntax of their
assembler of choice and the way the RESET interrupt functions. Experts and
developers of operating systems will enjoy the processor’s many features and the
easy transfer between supervisor, user, and interrupt modes. 


--- 2.1. MEMORY MODEL ----------------------------------------------------------

The YCPU’s eight data/address registers are each 16-bit. This means that all
data handled by a single register can only address values between 0-65,536 when
unsigned, or -32,768 to 32,767 when signed. The processor does have several
operations where two 16-bit operands combine to create a 32-bit results (for
example, multiplication). When this occurs, the ‘high’ 16-bits of the result
are stored in R0. The programmer has the choice to also store the low 16-bits
of the result in R0, which would overwrite the high bits, or choose a different
register for the destination of the low bits.

With regards to addresses, the 16-bit limit means that all logical addresses
can only address 64 kilobytes of memory at any time. However, using a memory
management unit (MMU), the processor can access multiple 64 kilobyte areas of
the processor at once. These areas are called ‘segments’. For example, the
processor might read code from one segment while copying data from a second 
segment to a third segment, while the stack operated on a fourth segment.

Where segments are located in memory memory, and how large they are, is
described by the processor’s segment registers. There are nine of these: four
describing the code, data, extra data, and stack segments for the processor’s
supervisor mode, and an identical four for the processor’s user mode. In
addition, there is one segment that describes the segment used when the 
processor is responding to an interrupt. The segment registers are 32-bits in
size.


--- 2.2. INSTRUCTION WIDTH: 16-BIT ---------------------------------------------

For most instructions, the only addressable unit of memory is a 16-bit word.
8-bit operations are supported for any instruction which uses the "ALU" bit
pattern: Load, Store, Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Bitwise And, Bitwise Or,
Bitwise Not, Bitwise Exclusive Or, Compare, and Negate. When executing 8-bit
operations in registers, the upper 8-bits of memory are cleared and ignored.
When executing an 8-bit STOre operation, the processor will store only one byte,
and the second byte in the 16-bit word in memory will not be affected. When
executing an 8-bit load operation, the processor will load only the lower byte
at the address, and the upper 8-bits of the destination register will be
cleared.

For all other instructions there is no support for 8-bit maths. All other
instructions operate on 16-bit vales at all times (with the exception of
MUL/MLI,  which has a 32-bit result with the upper 16 bits of the result stored
in R0).


--- 2.3. MEMORY ACCESS TO UNALIGNED ADDRESSES ----------------------------------

For 16-bit memory access, access is quickest when aligned to 2-byte boundaries,
and slower when accesses are unaligned. Thus, memory accesses from $0000 and
$0002 are faster than $0001 and $0003. For unaligned memory accesses, the YCPU
loads the two bytes for a 16-bit word in separate memory access cycles.

For 8-bit access, the YCPU loads only one 8-bit value. A single 8-bit load is
as fast as a 16-bit load.


--- 2.4. REQUIRED HARDWARE -----------------------------------------------------

When the processor first powers on and each time it is RESET, it returns to a
known state described in 2.G. The processor then executes instructions located
in an on-board read only memory (ROM) chip. To access this chip, the processor
relies on a hardware bus (YBUS). Thus, to execute any instructions the processor
must be connected to a bus and a ROM chip. Of course, any useful work will
likely require random access memory (RAM) as well, but RAM is not required to
use the processor. Note that the amount of RAM and ROM available to the
processor is not known to the processor. However, a programmer can query the
amount of RAM/ROM with the instruction HWQ #$03. For more information about this
query operation, please refer to 2.C.1.


=== 2.A. Registers =============================================================

    The processor has access to the following 16 16-bit registers:

    R0-R7: General Purpose Registers
    FL: Flags register
    IA: Interrupt Table Address
    II: Interrupt Device Address
    PC: Program Counter
    PS: Processor Status
    P2: Processor Fault Address
    SP: Stack Pointer. The YCPU has separate stack pointers for user mode (USP)
        and supervisor mode (SSP). See 2.A.2.

    The processor also has access to 9 32-bit segment registers. Four of these 
    are used for the code, data, extra data, and segments accessed in Supervisor
    mode, and four for the segments accessed in User mode. In addition, there is
    one Interrupt segment register, the segment used during Interrupts.

    CS: Code Segment. One for Supervisor (CSS), one for user mode (CSU).
    DS: Data segment. One for Supervisor (CSS), one for user mode (CSU).
    ES: Extra Data segment. One for Supervisor (ESS), one for user mode (ESU).
    SS: Stack segment. One for Supervisor (SSS), one for user mode (SSU).
    
    IS: Interrupt segment. Used in place of CS when I and M are set.


--- 2.A.1. GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTERS -------------------------------------------

The processor has 8 general purpose 16-bit registers. These registers are used
as both data and address registers, are completely interchangeable (orthogonal),
and are directly referenced and modified by most instructions.

There are a few exceptions to general purpose register interchangeability.

*   R0 is the destination of the high 16-bits of the result of MUL (multiply)
    and MLI (signed multiply) operations, which have 32-bit results. If R0 is
    also the src/dest register, then the high 16-bits are lost, and R0 will
    contain the low 16-bits after the instruction completes.

*   Only registers R4 - R7 can be used as index registers for indirect indexed 
    memory addressing. Thus, when executing an instruction with this addressing
    mode, at least one of the registers which are combined to create the memory
    address must be R4, R5, R6, or R7:
    
        Allowed:     LOD R1, [R0, R4] ; one register is R4-R7.
        Allowed:     LOD R1, [R4, R5] ; both registers are R4-R7.
        Disallowed:  LOD R1, [R0, R2] ; neither register is R4-R7.


--- 2.A.2. PROCESSOR CONTROL REGISTERS -----------------------------------------

The processor has eight 16-bit processor control registers. Unlike the general
purpose registers, these are not accessible by most instructions. The eight
processor control registers are FL, IA, II, PC, PS, P2, SSP, and USP.

    FL: The FLag register. This register contains flags that are set by ALU
        operations.
        The flags are as follows:
        FEDC BA98 7654 3210
        NZCV .... .... ....
            [N]egative, [Z]ero, [C]arry, o[V]erflow
         
    IA: Interrupt Table Address. This is the base address of the interrupt
        address table, comprised of 16 x 16-bit words.
        IA is initialized to $0000.
        
    II: The IRQ Index. This is the bus index of the device that raised the last
        hardware interrupt.
    
    PC: The Program Counter. Contains the address of the next instruction to
        execute. It is incremented by 2 after executing an opcode that does
        not reference a next word, or 4 after executing an opcode that does
        reference a next word value.
    
    PS: The Processor Status. Setting or clearing bits in this register enables
        and disables processor features. The bits are as follows:
        FEDC BA98 7654 3210
        SMI. QUW. .... ....
            [S] -   [S]upervisor Mode enabled
            [M] -   [M]emory segmenting hardware enabled
            [I] -   Hardware [I]nterrupts enabled.
            [Q] -   Interrupt Re[Q]uest in process, blocks hardware interrupts.
            [U] -   User-mode Fault
            [W] -   Segment Fault.
            
    P2: Processor Memory Fault Address. Set during segment fault interrupt.
        See 2.D.4. and 2.D.6.
    
    SP: The Stack Pointer is the address of the first full stack space. It is
        decremented before a stack value is pushed onto the stack, and is
        incremented after a stack value is popped from the stack. The stack
        grows downward from its initial address, and should be initialized to
        an address at (Stack Bottom + 1). Example: If SP is set to $0000, the
        first pushed value will be at $fffe, and the first pulled value will
        be read from $0000.
        
        The processor has two different stack pointers - the Supervisor Stack
        Pointer, or SSP, is used while the processor is in Supervisor mode, and
        the User Stack Pointer, or USP, is used while the processor is not in
        Supervisor mode. Thus, software running in User mode can ruin the
        stack, and the Supervisor mode stack will remain untouched. 

        
=== 2.B. Supervisor/User Modes =================================================
Supervisor mode is enabled when the S bit in the PS register is set, which is
true on processor boot and whenever an interrupt is called. When the S status
bit is clear, the processor is in User mode.

In Supervisor mode, the processor:
    * Can execute privileged opcodes.
    * Can set and clear all bits in the process status register.
    * Can read and write to all processor control registers.
    * Can directly access the hardware bus.
    * Uses the Supervisor Stack Pointer (SSP) for stack operations.
    * Uses the Supervisor segment registers.

In User mode, the processor:
    * Raises an 'Unprivileged Opcode' interrupt on executing privileged opcodes.
    * Cannot set or clear any bits in the process status register.
    * Cannot write to any processor control registers, but can read from them.
    * Cannot directly access the hardware bus.
    * Uses the User Stack Pointer (USP) for stack operations.
    * Users the User segment registers.


=== 2.C. Hardware Devices ======================================================
All additional Devices connect to the processor through a modular Hardware Bus.
This Hardware Bus can host up to 15 Devices. The processor can directly address
memory segments exposed by the Devices, and can also directly communicate with a
Device by executing a Hardware Query instruction. Devices can request the
processor's attention by raising an interrupt.

Possible hardware Devices can include input (keyboard, mouse, touch), storage
(disk, hard drive), networking, additional memory, and interfaces for hardware
not directly connected to the Hardware Bus.

Device Index 0 on the Hardware Bus refers to the YCPU itself. Software can
retrieve information about the YCPU by using the Hardware Query instruction to
query the Device at Index 0.

Note that Hardware Devices have full access to the YCPU's active memory, but
only one device or the processor can access memory at once. Thus, while a
device is reading or writing memory, the processor is stalled.


--- 2.C.1. INTERACTING WITH HARDWARE -------------------------------------------

Software interacts with hardware using the HWQ (HardWare Query) instruction.
This instruction includes one immediate 8-bit operation index. The possible
indexes are as follows:

    HWQ Index  Description
    $00        Query number of devices connected
    $01        Query device attached to bus in slot R0
    $02        Send message to hardware device
    $03        Get RAM/ROM amounts in R0-R3.
    $80        Get RTC time
    $81        Set RTC time
    $82        Get RTC interrupt interval
    $83        Set RTC interval

2.C.1.i. HWQ $00

Calling HWQ operation $00 will query the Bus for the number of devices
connected, and the YCPU will save this value in R0.

2.C.1.ii. HWQ $01

Software can determine what device is present in each of the 16 Bus Slots by
calling HWQ operation $01 with the index of the Bus Slot to check in R0. If no
device is present, R0 will be set to "ERR_NO_DEVICE" ($ffff). If a device is
present, the registers of the YCPU will be set as follows:

        R0: Device Type
        R1: Manufacturer ID
        R2: Device ID
        R3: Device Flags

2.C.1.iii. HWQ $02
        
Software can send messages to a Bus Device by calling HWQ operation $02. This
will send a two-word message, consisting of the words in R1 and R2, to the
Hardware Device in Bus Slot R0. If there is no hardware device in this Bus Slot,
there will be no effect. If there is an active Hardware Device in this Bus Slot,
one of several results will occur:

    If the device can instantly respond to the message, it will acknowledge the
    message by setting R0 to "MSG_ACK" ($0001). R1 and R2 may also be used as
    return parameters, if required by the device.
    
    If the device requires time to respond to the message, it will acknowledge
    the message by setting R0 to "MSG_WAIT" ($0002). When the device is ready
    to respond to the message, it will raise a Hardware Interrupt.
    
    If the device requires access to main memory, the processor will be halted
    while the device reads/writes to memory. Generally, the memory read to will
    be based on the contents of R1 and R2. Software can send more than two
    parameters to a device by using R1 or R2 as a pointer to memory. When the
    device has completed its operation, it will set R0 to "MSG_ACK" ($0001).
    
    If the device encounters an error while responding to the message, it will
    acknowledge the message by setting R0 to "MSG_ERROR" ($FFFF). R1 and R2
    will remain unchanged.

2.C.1.iv. HWQ $03

Software can query the YBUS for the total amount of attached RAM and ROM by
calling HWQ operation $03. After this operation, the total amount of RAM will
be set in R0 and R1, with the high 16-bits set in R1, and the total amount of
ROM will be set in R2 and R3, with the high 16-bits set in R3. If no RAM
exists, both R0 and R1 will be set to “NO_MEMORY” ($FFFF). If no rom exists,
both R2 and R3 will be set to “NO MEMORY” ($FFFF).


=== 2.D. Interrupts ============================================================
An interrupt is a signal which indicates that an event requires immediate
attention. Interrupts can be triggered by a hardware device, by software using
the SWI opcode, or when the processor encounters an error state.


--- 2.D.1. HARDWARE INTERRUPTS -------------------------------------------------

A device on the CPU's hardware bus may request the CPU's attention by asserting
an interrupt request (IRQ). While the Q status bit is clear and the I status bit
is set, the processor checks for IRQs before executing each opcode. If a
hardware device is asserting an IRQ when the processor checks, the processor
will load the bus index of the first device on the bus which is asserting an
IRQ into the II register, and then raise the 'hardware interrupt' interrupt.

Note that devices in lower index slots in the hardware bus always have
priority over devices in higher index slots.


--- 2.D.2. SOFTWARE INTERRUPTS -------------------------------------------------

An interrupt may also be triggered by the SWI opcode. In this case, the
processor will raise the 'software interrupt' interrupt vector, and the code
at that interrupt must determine what function has been requested, based on the
contents of the registers.

Unlike hardware interrupts, software interrupts will be acknowledged
regardless of the status of the Q status bit

The I status bit only applies to hardware interrupts, and thus software
interrupts will be acknowledged by the CPU if the I status bit is clear. 
    

--- 2.D.3. OTHER INTERRUPTS ----------------------------------------------------

The processor can also raise interrupts on its own in response to error
states. These interrupts are named and described 2.D.6., supra.

    
--- 2.D.4. THE INTERRUPT SEQUENCE ----------------------------------------------

When an interrupt is raised, the processor halts the current executing process.
It then executes the following sequence:
    1.  Save the state of PS to a temporary register.
    2.  If the processor is in User mode, set the U status bit in PS.
    3.  Set the S status bit in PS. The processor is now in Supervisor mode.
    4.  If this is a hardware interrupt, the Q status bit will be set. This
        blocks other hardware interrupts from occurring while the current
        interrupt is being processed.
    5.  If this is a Segment Fault, P2 is set to the address of the memory 
        address that raised the Segment Fault.
    6.  Push the saved PS to the Stack.
    7.  If the interrupt was caused by an error condition, PC is rewound to
        the instruction that caused the interrupt. See 2.D.4.i. for a list of 
        interrupts in which this occurs.
    8.  Push PC (possibly rewound above) to the Stack.
    9.  Set PC to Mem[IA + (InterruptIndex * 2)].
   10.  Execution continues.  

2.D.4.i. Interrupts raised by error conditions:
    For interrupts caused by an error condition, the PC is rewound to the 
    address of the instruction that caused the interrupt. These interrupts are:
    DivideByZero ($02), FPUError ($03), StackFault ($04), SegFault ($05),
    UnprivOpcode ($06), and UndefOpcode ($07). For all other interrupts, the
    PC is unchanged, pointing to the address following the instruction the
    processor was executing immediately prior to the interrupt.


--- 2.D.5. RETURNING FROM AN INTERRUPT -----------------------------------------

When an interrupt handler ends, it should call RTI, which restores the values of
PS and PC from the stack. If an interrupt handler modifies a register or changes
the segment registers, it should save the state of the registers and/or cache
before doing so, and restore the same before returning from the interrupt
handler.

Note that on RTI, PS bits are restored to the value they had prior to the
interrupt.

The RTI instruction follows this sequence:
    1.  Pop PC, PS from the Stack.
        PS bits Q, U, W, and E are cleared.
    2.  Execution Continues.
    

--- 2.D.6. THE INTERRUPT VECTOR TABLE ------------------------------------------

There are 16 interrupts in the Interrupt Vector Table. The software interrupt
is raised by the instruction SWI, and the Hardware Interrupt is raised by a 
hardware that asserts an interrupt request. All other interrupts are raised
by the processor itself on specified error states. The 16 interrupts are:

Idx Name            Description
$0  Reset           Raised when the processor's RESET line is pulled high.
                    The processor will follow the boot sequence (See 2.G.).
$1  Clock           Raised when the processor's Real Time Clock ticks. The tick
                    rate can be set by writing to the RTC register.
$2  DivideByZero    Raised when the processor executes a division or modulus
                    opcode where the operand containing the denominator is zero.
$3  RESERVED        Not currently used, never raised.
$4  StackFault      Raised when the processor executes a POP or PSH instruction
                    that would access an address outside of the stack segment.
$5  SegFault        Raised when the processor attempts to read from or write to 
                    an address within a Segment that has been protected from 
                    these operations. The UW bits in the PS register will 
                    describe the error, and the P2 register will contain the 
                    memory address that the processor attempted to access.
$6  UnprivOpcode    Raised when the processor attempts to execute a privileged
                    opcode while in User mode.
$7  UndefOpcode     Raised when the processor attempts to execute an UNDEFINED
                    opcode.
$8  RESERVED        Not currently used, never raised.
$9  RESERVED        Not currently used, never raised.
$A  RESERVED        Not currently used, never raised.
$B  RESERVED        Not currently used, never raised.
$C  HWI             A device on the Hardware Bus has requested an interrupt.
                    II = bus index of the requesting device.
$D  BusRefresh      Raised when the hardware on the bus has changed. Note that
                    all hardware ids at this point may be invalidated.
$E  DebugQuery      Raised when the processor's DEBUG line is pulled high.
$F  SWI             Raised by the SWI opcode.


--- 2.D.6. SEGMENT FAULTS ------------------------------------------------------

When a segment fault is raised, the processor status bits U, W, and E will
describe the operation that caused the segment fault:
        U W     Segment Fault Type
        0 0     Attempted access to segment that is not loaded. (P bit set)
        0 1     Attempted supervisor write of write-protected memory.
        1 0     RESERVED VALUE. Not currently used, never set.
        1 1     Attempted user write to write-protected memory.
        
Note that writes to ROM memory will fail silently unless the MMU is enabled and
the write-protect bit is set, which will result in a segment fault.


=== 2.E. Addressing Modes ======================================================
Many instructions are register-only: they can take only data loaded in registers
as their source. ALU (including LOD and STO) and JMP/JSR instructions can access
memory using these six addressing modes:

Addressing Mode     Syntax      Value is...
Immediate           $1234       Value of Next Word
Absolute            [$1234]     Mem[Next Word]
Register            Rx          Value of Register
Indirect            [Rx]        Mem[R]
Indirect Offset     [Rx,$1234]  Mem[R + Next Word]
Indirect Indexed    [Rx,Rx]     Mem[R+R] At least one of these registers must be
                                R4, R5, R6, or R7.

--- 2.E.1. BIT WIDTH OF INSTRUCTIONS -------------------------------------------

ALU instructions are by default 16 bits wide. Thus, all LOD instructions take
16 bits from memory, and ADD instructions operate on all 16 bits of memory.
There is an alternate 8-bit mode for ALU instructions (ADD, STO, LOD, etc.):

    LOD.8   [$8000]
    STO.8   [$8000]
    
These alternate instructions will operate on only the low 8 8-bits of a 
register. 8-bit LOD instructions will load a single byte into memory from a
register. The high 8 bits of the destination register will be cleared. 8-bit STO
instructions will store the low 8 bits from the source register. If the target
of the instruction is memory, only a single byte is stored in memory. If the
target is another register, the lower 8 bits of memory are stored, and the high
8 bits of the destination register are cleared.

--- 2.E.2. REFERENCING THE DATA AND EXTENDED DATA SEGMENT ----------------------

Normally, any address references to memory (with Absolute, Indirect, Indirect
Offset, or Indirect Indexed) will come from the address of memory within the
data segment (DS). This is implicit to the indirect addressing modes, but can
also be specified. Appropriate syntax for accessing the DS would be:
                
    LOD R0, [r1]     OR     LOD R0, DS[r1]

These addressing modes also allow references to the extra data segment (ES).
This must be made explicit. The appropriate syntax for accessing ES would be:

    LOD R0, ES[r1]
    

=== 2.F. Memory Management =====================================================
Because the processor has a 16-bit logical address space, it can only address
$10000 (65,536) bytes of linear address space at a time. This limited address
space is augmented by the processor's integrated memory management unit (MMU)
which, when enabled, implements segmented memory and thus a limited form of
virtual address translation.


--- 2.F.1. THE SEGMENT REGISTERS -----------------------------------------------

The processor’s Memory Management Unit allows access to segmented memory. There
are four segments available for access during normal program operation (the code
segment (CS), data segment and extra data segment (DS and ES), and the stack
segment (SS)) and a fifth segment (the Interrupt Segment (IS)) used as the code
segment when the processor is in Interrupt mode (‘I’ bit set in PS) and the
Memory Management Unit is enabled (‘M’ bit set in PS).

Each segment register is 32 bits in size:

    $03       $02           $01       $00
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210     FEDC BA98 7654 3210
    DWPA ssss ssss bbbb     bbbb bbbb bbbb bbbb

    D - Hardware device flag:
        0:  Accesses to this segment will come from main memory.
        1:  Accesses to this segment will come from the hardware device at 
            the index equal to the upper four ‘b’ bits (0-15). Where these bits
            are 0000, the accesses will come from the computer’s onboard ROM 
            chip.
    W - Write protection flag:
        0:  Write operations to this segment will succeed.
        1:  Write-protected. Writing to this segment will fail and cause a
            segment fault interrupt.
    P - Not present flag:
        If this bit is set, access to this segment will cause a segment fault.
    A - Accessed flag:
        This bit is set every time this segment is written to.
    s - These bits determine the size of the segment. This value is left shifted
        by 8 and incremented by 256 for a range of 256 - 2^16.
    b - These bits determine the base address of the memory that is mapped to
        this segment within virtual address space (note that the YCPU's ROM
        is indicated by setting the high 'b' bit for device 0).
        The base address is left shifted by 8 for a range of 0 - 2^24-256.
    

--- 2.F.2. ADDRESS TRANSLATION WHEN THE MMU IS DISABLED ------------------------

When the 'M' status bit is in PC clear, the MMU is disabled, and the segment
registers are not used for memory access. Accesses to memory occur as if the
segments were set to these values:
    
    CS: $8000 0000   ; CS in ROM, base = $00000000, size = $10000
    DS: $0000 0000   ; DS in RAM, base = $00000000, size = $10000
    ES: $0000 0000   ; ES in RAM, base = $00000000, size = $10000
    SS: $0000 0000   ; SS in RAM, base = $00000000, size = $10000
    IS: $8000 0000   ; IS in ROM, base = $00000000, size = $10000

--- 2.F.3. ADDRESS TRANSLATION WHEN THE MMU IS ENABLED ------------------------

While the 'M' status bit in PC is set, the MMU is enabled, and will translate
memory references to physical addresses using the contents of the segment
registers. This is done by adding the segment base address to the address of
the specified reference. The translation is as follows:

If the ‘D’ bit is set, then the YCPU requests device memory space from the YBUS
from the device with index equal to the upper 4-bits of the ‘d’ bits. If this
index equals 0, then the memory access is to on-board read only memory.
    1. The low 16-bit ‘base address’ portion of the segment register is
       shifted left by 8 (multiplied by 256).
    2. The logical address of the instruction is added to the base address.
    3. The combined value is the physical address.

       
       Logical address      $----1234
       Segment device index $-D------
       Segment base address $--8765--
       Device ‘D’ address:  $--877734

If the ‘D’ bit is clear, then the YCPU requests memory space from random
access memory (RAM) on the YBUS.
    1. The 20-bit ‘base address’ portion of the segment register is shifted
       left by 8 (multiplied by 256).
    2. The logical address of the instruction is added to the base address.
    3. The combined value is the physical address.

       Logical address      $----1234
       Segment base address $-98765--
       Memory address:      $-9877734

The segment used for a given memory address is implied by the opcode of the
executing instruction. All instructions, operands and immediate values are
taken from the Code Segment. All stack operations (push, pop) are taken
from the Stack Segment. All other instructions can use either the Data
Segment or the Extra data Segment.

Note that there are different Segment Registers for user and supervisor mode.
The supervisor can set both sets of Segment Registers, while the user mode can
set neither.


--- 2.F.4. FAR JUMPS -----------------------------------------------------------

The YCPU is internally 16-bit, and each segment can only address only 16-bits of 
logical address space. This includes the executing instructions in the code
segment. As noted infra, software may manipulate the segment registers using the
LSG (Load Segment Register) and SSG (Store Segment Register). This will change
the segments that are currently active in memory.

Running software may also replace the code segment register in memory using a
'far jump'. Where a normal jump instruction sets only the PC register, a far
jump will also write a new 32-bit value to the code segment register, which 
will now describe a new code segment containing the address the new PC value
will reference.

An example of a far jump with immediate addressing will help illustrate how this
works. Note that 'immediate addressing' indicates that the processor uses the
next word following the current instruction as the new value of the new PC. With
a far jump, the processor will us two words immediately following the first
operand as the second operand, least significant byte first, as follows:

    JMP.F   $FF06, $83600008
    
    The processor sees this instruction as 4 words (8 bytes) containing four
    sets of data:
    
    $07_____ $06_____ $05_____ $04_____ $03_____ $02_____ $01_____ $00_____
    DWPAssss ssssbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaa OOOOOOOO OOOOOOOO
    
    O = 16-bit opcode, indicating a 'far jump immediate' instruction.
    a = the address of the PC within the new segment.
    b = the base address of the new segment
    s = the size of the new segment.
    DWPA = protection bits of the new segment.
    
Following the operation, the PC will be set to $FF06, and CS will be set to 
$80000008, indicating that the code segment points to ROM (‘D’evice bit set,
upper ‘b’ bits equal zero) with the base of the segment at $00000800, and the
size of the segment equal to $03600.

Note 1: Far jumps are only accessible from Supervisor mode. If the processor
        attempts to execute a far jump while in user mode, the processor will
        raise an 'UnprivOpcode' exception. Thus, these instructions could still
        be used while in User mode; the processor interrupt would be used to
        'trap' these instructions. Alternatively, software running in User mode
        could use a SWI instruction for the same purpose, if the Supervisor mode
        program was designed to interpret this function.
Note 2: When the MMU is disabled, a far jump will still set the code segment
        register, but because the MMU is disabled, this will not effect the
        segment of the current executing code.

--- 2.F.5. ACCESSES TO MEMORY --------------------------------------------------

Any memory accesses to segments that are not loaded (‘P’ bit in segment register
set) or outside of a segment’s defined space (ex. read to address $c000 when
segment size is $08000), will result in a segment fault. 

Any memory accesses to addresses that are not connected to real memory will
result in a return of all bits set: ‘$ffff’).


        
=== 2.G. Boot/Reset Sequence ===================================================
At initial power on, the state of all memory, registers, and cache is unknown.
The processor raises the RESET interrupt at power on, placing the processor
in the following known state:

    RTC Tick <- Disabled            ; RTC will not raise interrupts.
    PS <- $8000                     ; Supervisor mode is enabled, all other
                                    ; processor features are disabled.
                                    ; Because the MMU is disabled, memory 
                                    ; accesses will be translated as per 2.F.2.
    IA <- $0000                     ; Interrupt vector table begins at $0000
    PC <- [InterruptTable[$0]]      ; Execute 'RESET' interrupt code.
    

=== 2.H. The Real Time Clock ===================================================
The processor contains an integrated Real Time Clock (RTC). The RTC maintains
and updates its internal time data indefinitely, even when the processor is
powered down. The processor can query the RTC for the current time.

--- 2.H.1. RTC Date/Time data --------------------------------------------------

The clock provides time data with the following precision:
    Year:    8 bits (0-255)
    Month:   4 bits (0-11)
    Day:     5 bits (0-31)
    Hour:    5 bits (0-23)
    Minute:  6 bits (0-59)
    Second:  6 bits (0-59)
    M.Sec.: 12 bits (0-1000)
    
This data is saved to R0-R3 upon calling HWQ $80, in this format:

                                                    FEDC BA98 7654 3210
                    R0: 8 bits Year, 4 bits Month   .YYY YYYY .... MMMM
                    R1: 5 bits Day, 5 bits Hour     ...D DDDD ...h hhhh
                    R2: 6 bits Min, 6 bits Second   ..mm mmmm ..ss ssss
                    R3: 16 bits Tick                tttt tttt tttt tttt
                    
The original epoch for this device is 1 January 1900 at Midnight. This device
will 'roll over' at 1 January 2156. YpsilonTech offers technical assistance at
exceptionally reasonable rates to companies who wish their software to
gracefully handle this roll-over. YpsilonTech accepts no responsibility for
software written without this assistance, and thus experience a "Y2156" bug.

A programmer may set the clock data by placing the appropriate data in R0-R3,
and calling HWQ $81.

--- 2.H.2. The CLOCK interrupt -------------------------------------------------

The RTC also provides a CLOCK interrupt that can be enabled or disabled. The
frequency of this interrupt, in hertz (times per second) can also be specified.
For example, an interval value of 1 would raise the CLOCK interrupt once per
second. An interval value of 100 would raise the CLOCK interrupt 100 times
per second.

A programmer may query the current interrupt interval with HWQ $82. After this
instruction, R0 will be set to the actual CLOCK interrupt rate.

The processor can set the desired interrupt interval with HWQ $83, with a value
indicating the desired interrupt frequency in R0. If R0 is $0000, the interrupt
will be disabled. Otherwise,  the CLOCK interrupt will be raised at a frequency
of R0 hertz, capped to a maximum of cpu frequency divided by 1024.

After this operation, R0 will be set to the actual CLOCK interrupt frequency.
Software can thus request a high CLOCK rate, and be informed of the actual CLOCK
rate by examining R0.

=== 2.I. Switching Context =====================================================
The RTI instruction can also be used to switch the processor into user mode,
even switching contexts entirely when doing so. 

--- 2.I.1. Switching from Supervisor Context to User Context -------------------

When the MMU is enabled, the layout of memory is different in Supervisor and
User modes. Thus, as long as the MMU's User mode memory has been set ahead of
time, the RTI instruction can be used to switch the context of a running
program.

To change context from supervisor to user mode, the MMU's user mode segment
registers should be set, and the stack should be loaded with user-mode values
for R0-R7, FL, USP, PS, and PC registers. The PS register value in the stack
should be set with the ’S’ bit clear (for user mode).

    1. Load the segment registers with the necessary user data (in this
       example, these stacks are stored as 8 16-bits words on the stack).
    2. Pop R0-R7 from the stack.
    3. Pop FL, USP.
    4. Use RTI to pop PS, PC from the stack (PC should have S bit cleared).
    5. Execution will continue.
            
            LSG USS
            LSG UES
            LSG UDS
            LSG UCS
            POP R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7
            POP FL, USP
            RTI ; pops PS and PC

To save the same context (when responding to an interrupt from user mode):

Note that upon entering the interrupt, the stack looks like this:

                            [ ... ]
                            [ PS  ]
                    SP -->  [ PC  ]

    1. Push FL and USP to the stack.
    2. Push R0-R7 to the stack.
    3. Save the user segment registers to the stack.

            PSH FL, USP
            PSH R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7
            SSG UCS
            SSG UDS
            SSG UES
            SSG USS

As an interesting aside, this context is only 40 bytes.

--- 2.I.2. Switching Context while in Supervisor Mode --------------------------

Switching context from supervisor to supervisor is more difficult, as modifying
the active MMU cache will change the instruction that PC is operating on. It is
advised that the software either disable the MMU as part of this operation,
or lay out the banks of memory in such a way that when changing banks, the 
context changing sequence will go on interrupted (the same sequence of context
changing might be used in all banks).

    
### 3. Instructions ############################################################

The YCPU's instruction set is comprised of 58 unique instructions (although an
assembler may define other instructions as 'macros' - for example, a one-cycle
NOP instruction could be defined as 'LOD R0, R0').

All instructions are comprised of single 16-bit program words. Some instructions
may be suffixed by a single 16-bit immediate value. One instruction - the far
jump immediate instruction - is suffixed by three 16-bit immediate values.

All instructions are defined by the 8-bit low octet of the 16-bit program word.
Attempted execution of a  program word that does not have a defined 8-bit low
octet will raise the 'undefined' interrupt.

        Note 1: When the ‘e’ bit is set, the ALU processes values in its 8-bit
                mode. To use 8-bit mode for ALU instructions, follow the normal
                opcode with a ".8" flag. Examples follow:
                
                Instruction             Compiled as:
                LOD.8   R0, $34         LOD R0 = $34, 8-bit operation. Hi-8 bits
                                        of immediate value are ignored.
                LOD.8   R0, $1234       LOD R0 = $34, 8-bit operation. Hi-8 bits
                                        of immediate value are ignored.              
                STO.8   R0, [R1,R2]     STO R0 = [R1,R2], 8-bit operation.
                
            The ALU operating in 8-bit mode has the following modified behavior:
            1.  Only the low 8-bits of the input registers are used.
            2.  Only the low 8-bits of the output register are set. The high 
                8-bits of the output register are cleared (set to '0').
            3.  The [N]egative flag bit is set if bit 7 is set (with 16-bit
                operations, the N flag is set if bit 15 is set).
            4.  Only the low 8 bits of an immediate value are loaded, and the
                following byte is skipped (the entire 16 bits of offsets and
                absolute values are still used).

        Note 2: When the ’s’ bit is clear, all accesses to memory are within the
                Data Segment (DS). When ’s’ is set all access are within the 
                Extra Data Segment (ES). Reference 2.E.2., infra.
                
        Note 3: There are two index register bits, which select register R4-R7.
                Thus, at least one register in indirect indexed addressing must
                be R4-R7; the other can be any of R0-R7. The index register bits
                select a register as follows:
                ii     Register
                00     R4
                01     R5
                10     R6
                11     R7
        
        Note 4: The control register operand indexes are as follows:
                Index   Desc.                                       User write?

                $04     II register                                 N

                $07     current Stack Pointer (USP / SSP)           Y

                It is always possible to read control registers to general
                purpose registers, regardless of supervisor/user mode. However,
                user mode is limited in which processors it can write to.
                
        Note 5: The instruction LOD R0, R0 will cause the processor to do
                nothing for one cycle - it is equivalent to NOP. All other
                LOD instructions that have the same register for source and
                destination have the same result.

        Note 1: When the 'F' bit is clear, the jump is 'near', and the PC will
                be set to the value implied by the addressing mode, within the 
                currently loaded 16-bit logical memory space.
                When the 'F' bit is set, the jump is 'far', and will not only
                change the PC, but will also change the logical memory space
                within the bank of the upper address. This process is detailed
                in 2.F.5., supra.
                Far jumps are only available in Supervisor mode.

=== 3.C. Bit Shifting Instructions =============================================

All bit-shifting operations must specify the number of bits to be shifted. This
number can be specified as an immediate constant from 1-16, or taken from a 
register. When specified as a constant, the number is the number of bit
positions to shift. When specified as a register:
    1. If the register value is equal to zero, no shift occurs. Flags are still
       effected.
    2. If the register value is between 1 and 15, a shift occurs with that
       number of bits.
    3. If the register value is greater than 15, a shift of
       (register value & 0x000F) bits occurs.


ASL         Arithmetic Shift Left
Shifts all the bits of Rx X bits to the left. The leftmost X bits are set to 0.
The carry flag is set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear. The
result is that Rx is multiplied by 2^X, treating Rx as an unsigned word, and
setting the carry flag if the result does not fit in 16 bits.
Syntax:
    ASL R0, 8       ; Arithmetic Shift Left of R0 by 8 bits.
    ASL R0, R1      ; Arithmetic Shift Left of R0 by (R1 & 0x000F) bits.
Operation:  
    N [Negative]    Set if bit 15 of the result is set.
    Z [Zero]        Set if Rx == 0.
    C [Carry]       Set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear.
                    Clear on shift zero.
    V [Overflow]    Not effected.
    
    
ASR         Arithmetic Shift Right
Shifts all the bits of Rx X bits to the right. The rightmost X bits are copied
from the old bit 15. The carry flag is set if any bits shifted out were 1,
otherwise clear. The result is that Rx is divided by 2^X, treating Rx as a
signed word, and setting the carry flag if the result does not fit in 16 bits.
For positive values, this operation will divide towards 0; for negative values,
this operation will divide towards -1.
Operation:  
    N [Negative]    Set if bit 15 is set.
    Z [Zero]        Set if Rx == 0.
    C [Carry]       Set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear.
                    Clear on shift zero.

This operation is equivalent to ASL.
Operation:  
    N [Negative]    Set if bit 15 of the result is set.

    C [Carry]       Set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear.
                    Clear on shift zero.
    V [Overflow]    Not effected.
    
    
LSR         Logical Shift Right
Shifts all the bits of Rx X bits to the right. The rightmost X bits are set to
zero. The carry flag is set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear. The
result is that Rx is divided by 2^X, treating Rx as an unsigned word, and
setting the carry flag if the result does not fit in 16 bits.
Operation:  
    N [Negative]    Set if bit 15 of the result is set.
    Z [Zero]        Set if Rx == 0.
    C [Carry]       Set if any bits shifted out were 1, otherwise clear.
                    Clear on shift zero.
    V [Overflow]    Not effected.

=== 3.E. Branch Operations =====================================================

Branch instructions allow software to change the PC relative to its current
value. Each branch instruction includes a signed byte value (the offset) in its
bit pattern:

    BRA Bit Pattern
    FEDC BA98 7654 3210                        
    bbbb bbbb OOOO Occc                    
        O = opcode
        b = signed 8-bit offset (-128 to +127)
        c = condition
        
When a branch opcode is executed and its condition is true, the signed offset is
added to the PC. Because instructions must be 16-bit aligned, the offset is
shifted left by 1 (multiplied by 2) to allow for an effective range of -128 to
+127 opcodes relative to the current PC.

=== 3.I. Stack Instructions ====================================================
The following registers can be specified for Stack Instructions:
R0-R7, A-C, I-J, X-Z, FL, PC, PS, SP, USP, P2, II, and IA. Specifying a register
twice (ex. R0 and A) will result in only one value popped to or pushed from
that register.

There are two separate operations for pop and two for pull, each addressing a
different set of registers. The first operation pops or pulls the eight general
purpose registers, R0-R7. The second operation pops or pulls processor control
registers SP, Fl, PC, PS, USP, P2, II, and IA. 

Two notes on pushing and pulling the stack pointers. First, 'SP' and 'USP' is
the value of these stack pointers BEFORE the operation. Thus if SP is $1000 and
the operation 'PSH SP' is called, SP will now be $0FFF and the first value on
the stack will be $1000. Second, 'SP' equates to the current stack pointer, and
thus could be either USP or SSP depending on the mode of the processor.
Executing 'PSH USP, SP' in user mode will push USP to the stack twice; the same
instruction in supervisor mode will push both USP and SSP to the stack.

Note that pushing and pulling 'PS', the processor status register, is a
privileged operation. Attempting to push or pull this register in user mode
will result in all other specified registers being pushed or pulled, followed by
an 'Unprivileged opcode' interrupt.

An assembler should transform a stack operation that includes registers from 
these two different register groups should split the operation into two
separate operations as follows: general purpose registers should always be
popped first, and pushed last. Thus these two example instructions:
    PSH R0, R1, SP, PC
    POP R0, R1, SP, PC              
Should be transformed into:
    PSH SP, PC
    PSH R0, R1
    POP R0, R1                      
    POP SP, PC              
    
    
POP         Pop values from the Stack into registers
Syntax: Pop Rx[,Rx,Rx...]
The processor sequentially loads values from the stack to the registers
specified. Regardless of the order of the registers specified in the
instruction, the registers are always popped in the following order:
    Bit pattern 0: R7, R6, R5, R4, R3, R2, R1, R0
    Bit pattern 1: FL, PC, PS, P2, II, IA, USP, SP
    
    
PSH         Push values from registers to the Stack
Syntax: Pop Rx[,Rx,Rx...]
The processor sequentially saves a number of values from the stack equal to
the number of registers specified.
Regardless of the order of the registers specified in the instruction, the
values registers are always pushed in the following order:
    Bit pattern 0: R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7
    Bit pattern 1: SP, USP, IA, II, P2, PS, PC, FL
    

=== 3.J. Processor Function Instructions =======================================

CLF         Clears bit(s) in the FL register.
Syntax: CLF [N][,C][,Z][,V]
The specified bits are cleared in the FL register. Any combination of the
possible bits may be specified in a single instruction.


HWQ         Sends a message to the Hardware Bus.
Syntax: HWQ $00
Sends a message with the specified identified to the Hardware Bus. This may
query the bus directly, or send a message to a hardware device.


LSG         Load Segment Register from Stack
Syntax: LSG [CS/DS/ES/SS/IS][_/S/U]
Pulls two 16-bit words from the stack. Loads these values as a little-endian
32-bit value into the specified register. A programmer may indicate which of
the nine segment registers should be loaded as follows:

        LSG CS or LSG CSS ; loads Supervisor Code Segment from Stack
        LSG DS or LSG DSS ; loads Supervisor Data Segment from Stack
        LSG ES or LSG ESS ; loads Supervisor Extra Data Segment from Stack
        LSG SS or LSG SSS ; loads Supervisor stack Segment from Stack
        LSG CSU           ; loads User Code Segment from Stack
        LSG DSU           ; loads User Data Segment from Stack
        LSG ESU           ; loads User Extra Data Segment from Stack
        LSG SSU           ; loads User Stack Segment from Stack
        LSG IS            ; loads Interrupt Segment from Stack


SEF         Sets bit(s) in the FL register.
Syntax: SEF [N][,C][,Z][,V]
The specified bits are set in the FL register. Any combination of the
possible bits may be specified in a single instruction.


SLP         Halts the processor until it receives an interrupt.
Syntax: SLP
Places the processor into a halted state. No further instructions will be
executed until a hardware interrupt is received, at which point the processor
will exit the halted state and continue execution after the interrupt is
handled.


SSG         Store Segment Register to Stack
Syntax: SSG [CS/DS/ES/SS/IS][_/S/U]
Pushes the value of the indicated segment register to the stack as two 16-bit
word values. A programmer may indicate which of the nine segment registers 
should be stored using the mnemonic seen in the LSG instruction description.
