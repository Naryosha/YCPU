Equivalent of i386 instructions to set up stack space for a function. ebp must
be saved, either by calling function or prior to this instruction:

    mov     ebp, esp
    sub     esp, 20
    
( which compiles to 5 bytes for small offsets, 8 bytes when offset is > 0x7F )

Set up stack frame. R7 is base pointer. Calling procedure must save r7.
Space is allocated on stack for 2 local and 2 temporary 16-bit word variables:

8 bytes, 10 for values greater than 0x20:
    lod     r7, sp
    sbi     r7, 10      ; for larger values, use sub r7, value
    sto     r7, sp
    adi     r7, 10
    
    
            [ first available stack space           ]
    sp =>   [ temp  #2                              ]
            [ temp  #1                              ]
            [ local #3                              ]
            [ local #2                              ]
            [ local #1                              ]
    r7 =>   [ return addr                           ]
            [ arg#1                                 ]
            [ arg#2                                 ]
            [ arg#3                                 ]
            [ caller's saved registers, as needed   ]
